####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I didn't really learn anything new about these elements during this challenge as the previous challenges this week make me familiar with them already.
####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Again I didn't learn much about positioning because I didn't use this command for my formatting.  I put everything in the correct position using the default and the display command.  As the pages get more complex I'm sure I will use the position command much more.
####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement?  What was most difficult?
The easiest were the header and footer, footer especially.  I did a few tweeks and the formating works for all of my pages.  The most difficult is the nav bar on my main page.  I still can figure out how to spread them out across the page yet shrink so they are still in a line and still visible when the page shrinks.
####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I don't know if I can specify one thing I learned.  The knowledge of how to format in CSS to make elements look different or the placement of elements is much solidified in my mind from this challenge.
