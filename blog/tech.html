        In our burgeoning knowledge of web development it has become obvious that web sites use more coding languages then just HTML and CSS.  The best and most complex sites implement languages such as Ruby and JavaScript to add features that otherwise wouldn't be possible.  So far in Phase 0 we have learned Ruby.  So what is Ruby on Rails?

      <p>
        Ruby on Rails is a framework built on top of the Ruby language designed to create and implement web sites faster and easier.  Similar to how Ruby is a language built on top of binary for ease of use, Ruby on Rails is built on top of Ruby for easier web development.  Some of the advantages of using Rails are that is has generators/scaffolding which provide great starting points.  There are a number of plugins you can install and it includes integrated testing tools.  As you can see Ruby on Rails could be a very handy tool for web development.
