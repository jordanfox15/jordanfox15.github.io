How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-It actually was really nice and helped me out a great deal.  I had already done 2.8 and I think I was making it to complicated.  My partner helped me understand better what we were doing and feel much better about the whole process.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-Yes, much so.  With a wireframe to look at it was quite easy to add the HTML elements that corresponded with it.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
-We decided a good wireframe had all the elements needed laid out to add to the html.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
-I don't think we learned anything really new.  Both of us had used it all before for other assignments and understood what we were doing.
